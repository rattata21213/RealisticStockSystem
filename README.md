# Realistic Stock System
This mod includes a set of configs, taking advantage of the mods [Kopernicus](https://github.com/Kopernicus/Kopernicus) and [Principia](https://github.com/mockingbirdnest/Principia), which will make the Kerbal Space Program's star system more realistic.
The changes that make the system more realistic include:
 - Every orbit has a non-zero inclination and eccentricity.
 - Every body's rotational axis is pointing in a different direction (even if only slightly)

As you might have guessed, this mod won't function fully without both [Kopernicus](https://github.com/Kopernicus/Kopernicus) and [Principia](https://github.com/mockingbirdnest/Principia). Make sure that both are installed for the full experience.
